            I have always wanted to do this, but never had a reason to.<br />
            This project animated a hamburger menu icon to switch to a closing icon when clicked. 
            It also had to revert back.  I learned that the transition: transform property can't handle translate and rotate separately, and had to use css animations instead.

            This animation originally was just the sun rise and set that faded to black, but isn't it much better with the moon coming out?  Well at least I like to think it is.  
            The triangle shapes in this were made with clip-path polygon, which was a new css property to me.  Now I feel I can really make any shape I want.... cue evil laugh here.

            The line chart, a very practical example and fun to do this without a library. I used the html elements svg and polyline to complete this one.  One this I had to learn was how to make this responsive.  
            The viewBox property on svg really made this possible.  Getting the the points and the different line segements to line up too a lot of math.
            I definitely would have preferred to use some javascript to calculate these values, but really trying to just flex my html/css muscles here.
